# electronicglove
This project is for physically handicapped people mainly deaf and dumb people they can communicate with normal people those are physically good, by using hand movements they can communicate easily with other members by using IR sensors fixed on glove, According to the user functioning of sensors takes place in the form of gestures, So important commands which are required for user  displays on serial  monitor and voice command through voice modules as output to understand for other people, using Arduino software IR sensors are integrated and voice module for speech along with Arduino Uno these are hardware components used in our project. For every physically hand capped people can possess their own needs, according to their commands we can include them to display as well as speech. Easy to handle using IR sensors to decrease stress level for the movement of hand glove. We are going to implement such system that not only deaf and dumb even blind can communicate each other without any requirements from other normal people. Our system is going to be very helpful for interaction with outside world.
